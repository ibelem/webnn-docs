# WebNN Testing

This guide covers the testing methodologies and tools available for validating WebNN implementations across different browsers and devices.

## Prerequisites

Before testing WebNN functionality, ensure you have properly configured your browser by following the [WebNN Installation](./installation.mdx) guide for your target backend (e.g., WebNN Windows ML / OpenVINO EP GPU).

## Web Platform Tests (WPT) / Conformance Test Suite

The WebNN API follows W3C standards and includes comprehensive test suites to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

### WebNN Web Platform Tests / Conformance Test Suite

The [WebNN Conformance Test Suite (CTS)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/webnn) is part of the [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/) project, a cross-browser test suite that ensures Web platform compatibility across all major browsers.

These tests provide confidence to:
- **Browser implementers** that their WebNN implementation is compatible with other browsers
- **Web developers** that they can rely on consistent WebNN behavior across browsers and devices

#### Web IDL Tests

**File:** `idlharness.https.any.js`

Validates that the WebNN API correctly implements the interfaces defined in the Web IDL specification. The test uses a daily-updated snapshot of the spec's Web IDL located at `../interfaces/webnn.idl`.

#### Validation Tests

**Location:** `validation_tests/`

These tests verify that WebNN methods properly validate input parameters according to the specification algorithms. They ensure invalid inputs are correctly rejected.

**Example:** `validation_tests/matmul.https.any.js` confirms that:
- Exceptions are thrown when input tensor ranks are less than 2
- Input tensor shapes must be broadcastable
- Other parameter validation requirements are met

#### Conformance Tests

**Location:** `conformance_tests/`

These tests verify that WebNN operators produce correct computational results.

**Example:** `conformance_tests/matmul.https.any.js` validates that N-dimensional matrix multiplication produces mathematically accurate outputs.

### Test Execution Contexts

#### Device Variations
WebNN supports multiple compute devices (CPU, GPU, NPU). Tests use `META: variant=?...` to run the same test across different device types automatically.

#### Global Contexts
WebNN interfaces are available in both Window and Worker contexts via `navigator.ml`. Tests use:
- `.any.js` convention
- `META: global=window,dedicatedworker`

This allows the same test to run in multiple JavaScript execution contexts.

**Note:** Most operator-specific tests only specify `global=window` to reduce compute overhead, as behavior differences between contexts for individual operators are unlikely.
